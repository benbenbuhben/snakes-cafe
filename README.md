**Author**: Ben Hurst

**Version**: 1.0.1

  

## Overview

Snakes Cafe is a command line utility that mimics the functionality of a point of sale (POS) restaurant system using basic Python tools and libraries.

## Getting Started
To run the program, follow these steps:
 1. Clone this repo onto your local.
 2. Navigate into the appropriate directory.
 3. In the terminal, run ```python3 snakes_cafe.py```

  

## Architecture

This program was written using Python 3.7 along with the ```textwrap```, ```sys```, and ```uuid``` libraries. Menu items are stored in nested objects within an array so they can easily be added/modified. Other than that, the architecture is very straightforward. Please have a look at the ```snakes_cafe.py``` in this repo for more info.
